**Git is not a database.—but what if it was?** With YAML datastore, you can make your data Git-friendly. 

YAML Datastore is a lightweight library that stores and manages data with structured plaintext files and YAML syntax, designed for use with version control systems. This enables you to gain the advantages of Git for your data—track changes at the feature level, store data across multiple systems, and merge data seamlessly.

# Introduction

## What is YAML Datastore?
YAML Datastore is a lightweight Typescript library designed for observable, human-readable data storage and retrieval using YAML files. It serves as an alternative to traditional databases that do not store data in a version control-friendly way.

## Purpose of YAML Datastore
YAML Datastore exists because we rather than try to add Git-like features to how we store and manage data, we want to do data management in a way that fits in Git. We found that existing systems attempting to use Git as a backend didn't account properly for structure. YAML Datastore automatically manages this structure with easy to understand rules that we explain in the Usage section. 

# Installation
Install the library in the root directory of your project using npm or yarn.

  `npm install yaml-datastore` 

  `yarn add yaml-datastore` 

# Overview
This section provides comprehensive details about how the YAML Datastore library organizes and stores data on disk, the algorithm used to transform in-memory objects and lists into a collection of YAML files, the data types supported, and the conventions followed for file layout.

TO DO: link to Use Cases

YAML Datastore implements the standard CRUD operations for transforming in-memory objects and lists into structured YAML files and back.

The results helper class captures operation outcomes, including status and content.

## Supported Data Types
YAML Datastore supports any data types that are supported in YAML (and JSON). YAML Datastore categorizes these data types as simple or complex. 

Simple data is data that can be stored in a single line in a YAML file. This includes all scalar types; scalar types in YAML are strings without newlines, numbers, booleans, or nulls. It also includes empty lists and empty objects. 

Complex data is data that requires more than one line to be stored in YAML file. This includes multi-line strings, (non-empty) lists and objects. This is implemented by storing the data in separate files, referenced from their parent list or object. This enables these complex types to be accessed in individual files instead of having to use more complex YAML formatting.
Nested objects and lists are split into their own files for modularity and clarity.

| Simple Data Types  | Complex Data Types |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| String w/o Newline: `"Hello World"`  |  Multi-line String |
| Number: `3.14`, `42`  | List |
| Boolean: `true`, `false` | Object|
| Null: `null` | |
| Empty String: `''` | |
| Empty List: `[]` | |
| Empty Object: `{}` | |

## Mapping Complex Data Types to Files

### Multi-line Strings
TODO

### Lists
listname.yaml

### Objects
model/_this.yaml

## References to Subfiles

## List Element IDs
TODO

# CRUD Operations
First we will discuss how each CRUD operation maps onto the library functions, then we will discuss use cases by function.

* Create 
  * Store
* Read 
  * Load
* Update  
  * TBD
* Delete
  * Delete
  * Clear

## Store Use Cases

This section provides an explanation for each identified use case in the YAML Datastore specification. For each use case we provide an example data structure along with its representation on disk and an explanation of why that is the representation. All of these use cases are of a element (an object or a list) named model.
