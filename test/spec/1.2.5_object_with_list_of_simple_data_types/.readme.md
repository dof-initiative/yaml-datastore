### Object with List of Simple Data Types

#### The Model to Store

In this case an object contains an object `personInfo` with a list of simple data. 

!include(model.json lang=json)

#### Resulting Directory Structure

Because it is an object, the data structure for this example has a directory named `model` to represent the object above named "model" that contains a `_this.yaml` file to store the object's properties. Because this property is a list, `model/_this.yaml` references the relative filepath of the list using the double-parentheses convention `((personInfo.yaml))`. Since this list contains only simple data types, all its properties can be stored directly in that yaml file. 

!include(.model_tree.txt lang=txt)

#### Contents of the Files

##### `model/_this.yaml`
!include(model/_this.yaml lang=yaml)

##### `model/personInfo.yaml`
!include(model/personInfo.yaml lang=yaml)
