### Object with Object of Complex Data Types

This use case demonstrates storing an object that contains an object with complex data.

#### The Model to Store

In this case, the model contains both multi-line strings and other objects.

!include(model.json lang=json)

#### Generated Directory Structure
As with all objects, the generated data structure for this example starts with a directory named `model` and the file `_this.yaml`. Because this object contains an object, there is now a sub-directory named `myObj` named after the object and contains its own `_this.yaml` file. Because the object contains complex data, this directory also includes additional files and directories.

!include(.model_tree.txt lang=txt)

#### Generated Files

##### `model/_this.yaml`
!include(model/_this.yaml lang=yaml)

##### `model/myObj/_this.yaml`
!include(model/myObj/_this.yaml lang=yaml)

##### `model/myObj/lyrics.txt`
!include(model/myObj/lyrics.txt lang=txt)

##### `model/myObj/primeNumbers.yaml`
!include(model/myObj/primeNumbers.yaml lang=yaml)

##### `model/myObj/personInfo/_this.yaml`
!include(model/myObj/personInfo/_this.yaml lang=yaml)
