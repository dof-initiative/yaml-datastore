### Object with Object of Complex Data Types

This use case demonstrates storing an object that contains an object with complex data.

#### The Model to Store

In this case, the model contains an object `myObj` with a nested object `personInfo`, a multi-line string `lyrics_txt`, and a list `primeNumbers`. 

!include(model.json lang=json)

#### Resulting Directory Structure
Like the previous examples, the data structure for this example has a directory named `model` to represent the object above named "model" that contains a `_this.yaml` file to store the object's properties. The `model/_this.yaml` contains the key `myObj` and the relative filepath using the double parentheses convention `((myObj/_this.yaml))` because this object contains complex data.

Because `myObj` contains complex data, it needs its own directory also includes additional files and directories. The `myObj/_this.yaml` file references the relative filepaths using the double parentheses convention: `((lyrics.txt))`, `((personInfo/_this.yaml))`, and `((primeNumbers.yaml))`. 
* The nested object results in a sub-directory named `personInfo` containing its properties in a `_this.yaml` file. 
* The multi-line string results in a text file named `lyrics.txt` containing the string content in the `myObj` directory. 
* The list results in a yaml file named `primeNumbers.yaml` in the `myObj` directory.

!include(.model_tree.txt lang=txt)
