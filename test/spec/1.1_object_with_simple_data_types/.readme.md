### Object with Simple Data Types

This use case demonstrates the simplest pattern in YAML Datastore, an object where all properties are of simple data types. 

#### The Model to Store

In this case, all the supported simple data types are present in the model. 

!include(model.json lang=json)

#### Resulting Directory Structure

Because it is an object, the data structure for this example has a directory named `model` to represent the object above named "model" and contains a `_this.yaml` file to store the object's properties. For this case, that is the only file present because we can store all of the properties in a single line. 

!include(.model_tree.txt lang=txt)

#### Contents of the Files

##### `model/_this.yaml`

Since this is all simple data types, the on disk representation in YAML is a direct translation of the JSON representation to YAML representation. 

!include(model/_this.yaml lang=yaml)
