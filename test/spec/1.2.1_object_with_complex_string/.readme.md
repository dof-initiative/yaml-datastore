### Object with Complex String

This use case demonstrates storing an object that contains a complex string.

#### The Model to Store

In this case, `lyrics_txt` contains a multi-line string. Because the key will reference a text file, the convention `_txt` maps to `.txt`.

!include(model.json lang=json)

#### Resulting Directory Structure

Because it is an object, the data structure for this example has a directory named `model` to represent the object above named "model" that contains a `_this.yaml` file to store the object's properties.

!include(.model_tree.txt lang=txt)

#### Contents of the Files

##### `model/_this.yaml`

The first three properties in this file are simple data, and thus in one line. The fourth property, `lyrics_txt`, is a complex string, therefore we use the convention of enclosing the filename where the string contents will be stored in double parentheses, `((lyrics.txt))`.

!include(model/_this.yaml lang=yaml)

##### `model/lyrics.txt`

This text file stores the data for the multi-line string that was stored in `lyrics_txt`.

!include(model/lyrics.txt lang=txt)
