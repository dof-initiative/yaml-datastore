### Object with Complex String

This use case demonstrates storing an object that contains a complex string.

#### The Model to Store

In this case, `lyrics_txt` contains a multi-line string. Because the key will reference a text file, the convention `_txt` to represents `.txt`.

!include(model.json lang=json)

#### Generated Directory Structure

As with all objects, the generated data structure for this example starts with a directory named `model` and the file `_this.yaml`.

!include(.model_tree.txt lang=txt)

#### Generated Files

##### `model/_this.yaml`

In this file, we use the convention of enclosing the filename in double parentheses, `((lyrics.txt))` to reference the file storing the data.

!include(model/_this.yaml lang=yaml)

##### `model/lyrics.txt`

This text file stores the data for the multi-line string. 

!include(model/lyrics.txt lang=txt)
